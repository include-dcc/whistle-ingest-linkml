NCPI-FHIR-IG:
  # Source types can include:
  #   - IG - for resources that are the end product of HL7's publisher.jar
  #          application. The IG can be a local path or a published IG
  #   - FILES - for resources that are located on the local disk or urls
  source_type: IG
  # For IGs published to the web, point to the root directory containing the 
  # preferred version of the IG website. There should be a zip file containing 
  # the resource items which will be downloaded and subsequently loaded into 
  # the FHIR server
  url: https://nih-ncpi.github.io/ncpi-fhir-ig
  # 
  # If the IG exists locally on your machine, you can point to that directory
  # instead. This assumes that the products to be loaded are found in the 
  # output directory and have been zipped up according to standard publisher
  # behavior
  # path: /some/local/path/to/ig

  # List of resources to load. If you only care to load CodeSystem and 
  # ValueSets that were produced by publisher, simply comment out the 
  # StructureDefinition option.
  resources: 
  -  CodeSystem
  -  ValueSet
  -  StructureDefinition

  # If there are items that should be ignored, at them to the exclude-wildcards
  # Each entry will be treated as surrounded by wildcards.
